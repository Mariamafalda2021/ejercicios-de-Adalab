        <p> In September 1620, a small ship called the Mayflower left Plymouth, England, carrying 102 passengers—an
            assortment of religious separatists seeking a new home where they could freely practice their faith and
            other
            individuals lured by the promise of prosperity and land ownership in the "New World." After a treacherous
            and
            uncomfortable crossing that lasted 66 days, they dropped anchor near the tip of Cape Cod, far north of their
            intended destination at the mouth of the Hudson River. One month later, the Mayflower crossed Massachusetts
            Bay,
            where the Pilgrims, as they are now commonly known, began the work of establishing a village at
            Plymouth.Throughout that first brutal winter, most of the colonists remained on board the ship, where they
            suffered from exposure, scurvy and outbreaks of contagious disease. Only half of the Mayflower’s original
            passengers and crew lived to see their first New England spring. In March, the remaining settlers moved
            ashore,
            where they received an astonishing visit from a member of the Abenaki tribe who greeted them in English.
